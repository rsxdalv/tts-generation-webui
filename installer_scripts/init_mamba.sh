#  using micromamba (an 8mb static-linked single-file binary, conda replacement).
# For users who already have git and conda, this step will be skipped.

# This enables a user to install this project without manually installing conda and git.

Error downloading TTS Generation WebUI. Sorry about that, please try to:
 1. Run this installer again.
 2. If those steps don't help, please copy *all* the error messages in this window, and ask the community at https://discord.gg/3JbBrKrH
 3. If that doesn't solve the problem, please file an issue at https://github.com/rsxdalv/tts-generation-webui/issues

Thanks!
